## Requirements
A working installation of `docker` and `docker-compose`

## Getting started
This application comes with an example configuration for running with `docker-compose`. To get started rename `.env.dist` to `.env` and `docker-compose.yml.dist` to `docker-compose.yml` and adjust both configuration files to your local needs.

The file `docker-compose.yml.dist` contains a default configuration suitable for local development. To build the images and run tests:
```bash
$ ./build.sh
```

Now you are ready to start the containers
```bash
$ docker-compose up -d
```

To setup your `.env` file follow the instructions given from
```bash
$ docker-compose exec php lima app:setup
```

For more information on how to manage containers, please refer to the [docker-compose CLI reference](https://docs.docker.com/compose/reference/overview/#command-options-overview-and-help)

## Useful commands

```bash
# Drop schema and run all migrations (empty table state)
$ docker-compose exec php init-db.sh

# Create a new user (any role)
$ docker-compose exec php lima app:create-user
```

## Enable HTTPS

The default nginx config for development contains configuration for HTTPS support.
The only thing you need to do is to generate a certificate. You can use a self-signed certificate for simplicity, if you
can tolerate the warnings in the browser.
But there are already scripts helping you to generate a local CA certificate, which you can install in your browser or
operating system.

For generating a local root CA certificate, please refer to `docker/nginx/generate-root-cert.sh`. Please read the script
and verify the paths are valid for your system before running.

To generate a signed certificate for `localhost`, please check out `docker/nginx/generate-site-cert.sh`. Sames rules for
that script: Please have a look inside, before running it.

If you need to change paths, make your sure to reflect the changes in `docker-compose.yml` and your nginx configuration.

## OS users & file permissions

Configure `user: 1000:1000` in `docker-compose.yml` if you want to mount the project files into the container.
